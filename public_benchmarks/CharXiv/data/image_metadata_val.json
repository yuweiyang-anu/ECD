Excess mortality for each country is calculated based on daily data on deaths sourced from Statistics Denmark (DST, Denmark), Statistics Sweden (SCB, Sweden) and ISTAT (Italy). Deaths data for Denmark and Sweden cover the whole population, whereas the Italian data is available for approximately half of all Communes. Excess mortality is calculated as the percentage difference between the total number of deaths from all causes in a week in 2020 and the average number of total deaths in that week, 2015-2019. Excess Google searches are calculated based on data from Google Trends of weekly indices of search intensity for the terms ``cough\" (DK: ``hoste\", SE: ``hosta\", IT: ``tosse\"), ``fever\" (``feber\", ``feber\", ``febbre\"), ``sick\"  (``syg\", ``sjuk\", ``malato\").

In addition, the red and blue portions of the orbit display the first and second collisions, respectively. Although the profile and velocity of the red pulse were similar to those of the blue pulse when they were almost colliding with the bump, the outcomes of the first and second collisions varied. As discussed in Section 5, the pulse orbit coincided with the basin boundary at the critical bump height in a reduced finite-dimensional system, which was indicated by the left stable manifold of the saddle point located at the center of bump for the PEN--REB case (left). At this instant, the basin of attraction in the phase space was categorized into two parts by the pulse orbit itself. Therefore, in case the bump height is proximate to the critical bump height and the initial profile is almost identical to that of the TPO, a slight variation in the initial setting causes a drastic variation in the outcome after collision. Moreover, similar basin structures were observed in other cases as well, as detailed in Section 5.\n    ",

Panels and colors show the same quantities as in Fig. 1C. The inoculum initially centered about the origin slowly consumes nutrient (purple), establishing a slight gradient that allows partial planktonic dispersal (green curves moving outwards); the cells also produce autoinducer (red) concomitantly. Because nutrient is consumed slowly, autoinducer production is not limited, resulting in partial biofilm formation (blue). Autoinducer has sufficiently accumulated above the threshold after $t \\approx 14$ \\si{\\hour}, which causes a population of biofilm cells to form at the origin ($x/x_0 \\approx 0$). After $20$ \\si{\\hour}, the biofilm population continues to grow, and additionally, autoinducer concentration exceeds the threshold concentration at $x/x_0 \\approx 10$. Thus, we see a second population of biofilm cells form, centered at $x/x_0 \\approx 10$.

Shown below each phase is the weighted interval score (WIS, lower is better) for $N_t$ nowcasts of each approach during a selected week (grey shade) over 50 scenario runs. Colored bars show average scores, decomposed into penalties for underprediction (crosshatch), dispersion (circles), and overprediction (stripes). The horizontal proportion bar below shows the percentages of runs where each approach performed best.
