The profiles are measured with the solid annuli, and the sky values are measured by the ring in dashed line. The two cases shown illustrate how artificial flattening and/or steepening can both emerge, depending on the geometry and brightness of the contaminating sources. (a) In this case, the geometry of contaminating starlight allows the sky level to be accurately estimated, so that `leaking' light from bright stars is assigned to the target, which causes a flattening in the measured profile.   (b) In this case, azimuthal averaging results in an over-estimated sky value and thus an artificial steepening in the object's profile. In both cases, heavy masking could be used in an attempt to mitigate these issue, but at the cost of reducing the number of pixels for analysis.

Estimated phase markers of the peripheral clock (blue dot) and the central clock (red dot) are plotted against the pattern of the light-dark cycle and feed-fast cycle. The light-dark cycle is composed of 12 hours of light (yellow) and 12 hours of darkness (gray). The feed-fast cycle consists of 4 equally distributed meals a day, where the black bar represents the food availability. The subjects are initially entrained to a 12:12 light:dark cycle. On day 0, the schedule shift occurs. Two schedules, a 6-hr phase delay, and a 6-hr phase advance are compared. Times during re-entrainment are colored in magenta. (A) and (B) represent the re-entrainment process for a young subject using the default parameter set. We can see that both the central clock and the peripheral clock in a young subject complete the phase-delay re-entrainment in 5 days and complete the phase-advance entrainment in 6 days. To model an age-associated decline in the sympathetic nervous system, we reduce the strength of the downward coupling $K_{LF}$ from 0.06 (default parameter set, A and B) to 0.035 (C and D). With a reduced value of $K_{LF}$, the central clock (red dots) is not affected, but the peripheral clock (blue dots) exhibits slower adjustment compared to (A) and (B). As a result, an attenuated sympathetic pathway leads to longer re-entrainment processes---7 days for phase delay and 9 days for phase advance.",

The second quench is applied when the fluctuations following the first quench reach their maxima and the time ${t_2}$ is counted after the second quench.

We observe that the critical fluctuations do not monotonically grow for increasing system sizes, as would be expected from the scaling relations. This effect can be attributed to the imperfect switching time between the first and second quench; a nearly perfect collapse can be reproduced numerically using the precise switch times (SI Sec.~V.C). We also report exponents found by a power-law fit of the maximum fluctuations which agree more closely with the analytical prediction (\\textbf{Inset c.}). While determining the experimental critical exponents, we have excluded 50 ion data (gray) [see main text for details].

We seek to find a conic section that best separates the positive and negative populations.  However, attempting to work directly with the empirical data is like threading a needle; there is a significant chance that too many data points will end up on the wrong side of the boundary.  See Fig.\\\\ref{fig:nohomotopy}, for example.  Thus, we blur out the data to temporarily diminish the significance of individual points.  Intuitively, this simplifies the each iteration of the optimization by finding the surface that best separates the blue and yellow shaded areas.  The degree of blurring is proportional to $\\sigma$.  Going left to right and top to bottom, the four values of $\\sigma$ are $\\sigma_1=1$, $\\sigma_2=0.25$, $\\sigma_3=0.1$, and $\\sigma_4=0.05$.  The final boundary computed for $\\sigma_j$ is used as the initial guess in the optimization for $\\sigma_{j+1}$.  The color scale is created by convolving the empirical distributions for positive and negative samples with a Gaussian probability density function with a standard deviation $\\sigma$.  This is done for illustrative purposes and does not reflect the specifics of how data is blurred.\nNote that as $\\sigma\\to 0$, the objective function becomes the empirical classification error, which is the quantity we wish to minimize.",
